#Create three different programs to run your robot through the three different mazes. Each maze will be worth 5 points. You must have pseudocode to receive full credit.
#You should see the folder with the robots and mases on the left hand side of your screen, as well as the three files that you will build your program into.
#** Maze 3 is best with a nested while loop**
#Please email me with any questions.


# Not sure if you wanted these to run one after another, for the time being just uncomment a specific line and run it

# import maze_1.py
# import maze_2.py
# import maze_3.py
